## Array Check For Understanding

# Once you feel comfortable with arrays, please send a slack DM to your instructors with your responses to the following questions.

# Given the following Array:
# numbers = [1, 4, 6, 9, 10, 23, 56]

# What is the value of the element at index 0?
    # 1
# What is the value of the element at index 3?
    # 9
# In code, how would you return the value of the element at index 2?
    # numbers[2]
# In code, how would you add the number 66 to the end of this array? 
    # numbers.push(66)
# In code, how would you figure out how many elements are in this array? 
    # numbers.count
# What are 3 other array methods you learned? What do they do? 
    # reverse - returns a new array with the values in reverse order.
    # unshift() - adds a new value to the front of the array and returns the new array.
    # push() - adds a new value to the end of the array and returns the new array.
# On a scale of 1-5, 5 being “very comfortable” and 1 being “not at all comfortable”, how would you rate your current confidence with   using arrays? 
    # I would give myself a 3.5. I feel comfortable with how to call methods on array. I feel I still need practice and be more familiar with what each of the most commonly used array methods do.
